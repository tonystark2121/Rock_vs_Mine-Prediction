Rock vs Mine Prediction using Logistic Regression
This repository contains code for a logistic regression model trained on numerical data to predict whether an object is a rock or a mine based on its sonar signature.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Sonar dataset, which contains sonar readings from a metal cylinder (mine) and a roughly cylindrical rock. The data consists of 60 numerical attributes, with no missing values. The dataset has a total of 208 instances, out of which 111 are mines and 97 are rocks.

Model
We used logistic regression to build a binary classification model that predicts whether an object is a mine or a rock based on its sonar signature. We trained the model using a numerical standard mean of logistic regression. The model was implemented using the scikit-learn library in Python.

Files
The following files are included in this repository:

sonar.csv: The dataset used to train and test the model
rock_vs_mine.ipynb: A Jupyter notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model training and testing, and evaluation
README.md: This file, which provides an overview of the project
Requirements
The following libraries are required to run the code:

Python 3.6+
NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib
Jupyter Notebook
Usage
To run the code, first, clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/<username>/rock-vs-mine-prediction.git
Navigate to the project directory and install the required libraries:

bash
Copy code
cd rock-vs-mine-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
Launch Jupyter Notebook:

Copy code
jupyter notebook
Open the rock_vs_mine.ipynb notebook and run the cells to preprocess the data, train and test the model, and evaluate its performance.

Results
Our model achieved an accuracy of 81% on the test set, which is a reasonably good performance given the limited amount of data available. The model could be further improved by using more advanced feature engineering techniques, such as dimensionality reduction or feature selection, or by using more advanced machine learning algorithms, such as neural networks.
